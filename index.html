<h3>Project 1</h3>
  <p><a href="https://norlandio.github.io/SumLikeThat/">Project 1</a></p>
<p> 'Summ Like That' is a poem about success and habit 
<br>
or sum like that. 
<br>
It was made with the idea of success in mind, and words from the internet as my path for a story. .</p>

<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p><a href="https://twinery.org/2/#/stories/3816bab5-2797-4ca9-b9be-db8f16cbf373">Project 2</a></p>
<p>A driving simulator or a decision guesser?
<br>
I created this story with the idea of what decision led to my current situation I've been in. 
<br>
I thought of this while driving and just for fun went with the flow of the story.
<br>
Made with Twine.</p>
